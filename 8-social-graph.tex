\section{Social Graph}

In social graph, we often want to extract communities, use clustering


Strong and weak communities, for a given vertex $i$ we define

\begin{itemize}
  \item the internal degree $k_i^{int}$ the number of edges from $i$ going to another vertex of the community
  \item the external degree $k_i^{ext}$ the number of edges from $i$ going to a vertex outside of the community
\end{itemize}

$k_i^{int}$ should be high and $k_i^{ext}$ should be low, otherwise change the community. We should have

\[
  \sum_{i\in C} k_i^{int}(C) > \sum_{i\in C} k_i^{out}(C)
\]
